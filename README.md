# Bikesharing
Using Python to prep bikeshare data to then visualize in Tableau

## Overview of Citibike Data Cleanup
### Purpose
For this analysis, I used Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, youâ€™ll create a set of visualizations to:

- Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
- Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
- Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

### Citibike Analysis Summmary
Bike share programs are profitable and could lead to a profitable ROI if the items below are taken inter consideration and recognized.


- **Males dominate citibike userbase:** Men are almost 3 times more likely to use citibike than females
- **Bikeshare hubs should be in densely populated areas:** Evidence shows that both starting and end point locations are frequent in densely populated areas of NYC
- **Average user checks out bikes for multiple hours:** Need to make sure you have enough bikes to satisfy demand as bikes are typically checked out for 5 hours
- **Bikes are used as a commute alternative:** Should continue to invest marketing spend showing bike share is a great alternative to taking public transit and owning a bike
- **A majority of riders are subscribers:** Fantastic indication that many users are loyal and recognize benefits of subscribing
